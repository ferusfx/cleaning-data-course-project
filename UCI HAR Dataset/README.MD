Course Project from the Coursera Course: Getting and Cleaning Data (John Hopkins University)
==================================================================

All project-related materials can be found in the UCI HAR Dataset directory. 

* Unzip the source archive (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) into a folder on your local drive, i.e. C:/Users/YOURNAME/Desktop/R

* Make sure the run_analysis.R file is in the appropriate root path: i.e.: C:/Users/YOURNAME/Desktop/R/Coursera/3 Getting and Cleaning Data/Course Project/UCI HAR Dataset

* In RStudio: Open the file: run_analysis.R, adjust the top source path (inside the UCI HAR Dataset folder).
Type into the console: source("run_analysis.R")

* After running the R-file a file named 'TidyDataSet.txt' should have been created.
